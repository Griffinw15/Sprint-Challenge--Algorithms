#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)

O(log n)


b)

O(n log n)


c)

O(n)

## Exercise II

should try a binary search

If the building is 100 floors, we can guess floor 50 first. The egg will either break or not. If it breaks I then would guess floor 25, if it does not I would go to 75. So on and so forth, worse case scenario I go to 50 floors. This cuts workload in half.

I think binary search has a O(log n) runtime
